# Web page of a cupcake recipe
### This is a simple web page made with HTML and CSS. While this project wasn’t my first time using them, it’s my first project since I decided to become a developer.
### This project was made in the Rocketseat Full-Stack Course, as the first project in the journey. More than just coding, they also taught valuable best practices in the programmin area.
